Ahaar is an intelligent Android application designed to enhance nutrition tracking by detecting foods in real-time, analyzing nutritional values, and helping users maintain a balanced diet. Powered by machine learning, Ahaar identifies food items on a plate, tracks nutritional intake (calories, fats, proteins, etc.) daily, weekly, and monthly, and provides personalized diet recommendations to meet individual health goals.

## Why We Created Ahaar

In India, lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease are rising at an alarming rate. Nearly **8-10% of the population** is affected by diabetes, and **40% are overweight**. These aren‚Äôt just numbers; they represent our family members, friends, and neighbors facing serious health challenges every day.

### The Mission Behind Ahaar

We created **Ahaar** to empower individuals to take control of their nutrition and, ultimately, their health. Our goal is to simplify meal tracking, making it accessible and insightful for every user. By providing instant nutritional information and personalized recommendations, Ahaar goes beyond calorie counting to guide users in building healthier habits. It bridges the knowledge gap many Indians have about nutrition, especially when it comes to traditional Indian foods.

### Why Ahaar is Important for India

- **Addressing Health Issues**: The increase in diabetes, heart disease, and obesity in India highlights the need for proactive nutrition management. Ahaar helps users understand what‚Äôs on their plates and make choices that reduce health risks.
  
- **Cultural Relevance**: Indian diets include unique foods like roti, dal, and samosas, which often lack clear nutritional data. Ahaar brings this information to users, making it easier to appreciate the health impact of traditional Indian meals.

- **Filling the Knowledge Gap**: Detailed nutritional knowledge is limited in many regions. Ahaar provides users with instant access to accurate nutritional values, empowering them to make well-informed dietary decisions.

- **Time-Saving Convenience**: Ahaar streamlines the process of tracking meals and analyzing nutrition, offering quick, reliable insights that help users focus on their health without extra effort.

### The Vision

With **Ahaar**, we aim to reduce lifestyle diseases by promoting awareness and supporting healthier eating choices for millions of Indians. Whether in urban centers or rural areas, Ahaar makes nutrition tracking easy, accessible, and impactful, enabling everyone to build healthier habits for a better future.

## üéØ Purpose

Ahaar aims to make nutrition tracking simpler, more accurate, and goal-oriented by leveraging artificial intelligence. It empowers users to make informed dietary decisions, ultimately supporting a healthier lifestyle.

---

## üí° How It Works

1. **Food Detection**: Ahaar uses a machine learning model to identify foods from images captured by the device's camera.
2. **Nutritional Calculation**: Once detected, Ahaar calculates the nutritional values of each food item, including macronutrients (carbs, proteins, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals).
3. **Goal Tracking**: Users can set dietary goals, and Ahaar will track progress across different time periods.
4. **Diet Recommendations**: Based on the user's current intake and goals, Ahaar suggests food choices and modifications to optimize their diet.
